## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Money Value Object
The project already has a robust Money value object at `src/lib/money-value-object.ts` with:
- Proper cents-based calculations
- Currency validation
- Mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Comparison methods
- Formatting capabilities

### Current Architecture
- NestJS with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- JWT authentication with Passport
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Stripe for payments
- WebSocket gateways for real-time updates

### Dependencies Already Available
- `@nestjs/jwt` - JWT handling
